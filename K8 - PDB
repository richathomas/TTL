A Pod Disruption Budget is created by an application owner for each application. A PDB limits the number pods of a repliated application that are down from voluntary disruptions. 
Ex: An application in created in a deployment wih 5 replicase and the client wants the application to have servicng load never falls below a certain percentage, thus a PDB is created along with the deployment to ensure that the application always run even when the cluster/ node fails.

There are certain cases with which the pods are affected including:
1. A hardware failure of the physical machine backinng thee node.
2. A cluster administartor deletes the VM(instance) by mistake.
3. A kernel Panic.
4. Node disappears from the cluster due to cluster network partition.
5. A cloud provider or hypervisor failure makes VM disappear.

Voluntary disruptions:
1. Deleting the deployment that manges the pod.
2. Updatig a deployment ppod tempalte causing a restart
3. Directly deleting the pod.

Cluster Administartor actions include:
